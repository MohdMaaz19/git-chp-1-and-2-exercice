                                                                        Exercise 1.1.1

Q 1->Run git help at the command line. What is the first command listed?

A:
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]



Q 2->There’s a chance that the full output of git help was too big to fit in your terminal, with most of it just scrolling by. 
What’s the command to let us navigate the output of git help interactively? (On some systems, you can use the mouse to scroll back in the terminal window, 
but it’s unwise to rely on this fact.) Hint: Pipe the output to less.

A:
git help | less


Q 3->Git stores global configuration settings in a hidden text file located in your home directory. 
By inspecting the file ~/.gitconfig with a tool of your choice (cat, less, a text editor, etc.), 
confirm that the configuration set up by Listing 1.3 corresponds to simple text entries in this file. 

A:
mohdmaaz@Lenovo:/$ cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
	email = mohdmaazshk@gmail.com
	name = mohdmaaz
[init]
	defaultBranch = main


                                                                        Exercise 1.2.1

Q 1-> By running ls -a (discussed in Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous), list all the files and directories in your website directory.

A:
mohdmaaz@Lenovo:~/repos/website$ ls -a
.  ..  .git

What is the name of the hidden directory used by the Git repository? (There is one such hidden directory per project.) 

.git

Q 2-> Using the result of the previous exercise, run ls on the hidden directory and guess the name of the main Git configuration file. 
Use cat to dump its contents to the screen.  

A:
ls -a .git 
mohdmaaz@Lenovo:~/repos/website$ ls -a .git
.  ..  branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs

Main Git configuration file -> config

Content of git.config
mohdmaaz@Lenovo:~/repos/website$ cat .git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
